# ALIGN: hostel maintenance apps for IIT Roorkee (project memory for Claude)

Read this first. It replaces the earlier chat history.

## The owner
Siddhesh (design student). Explain things in very simple, step-by-step language, like to a 6th-standard student.
He is a designer: he wants the apps to look exactly like his Figma, feel alive, and avoid generic "AI default" UI.

## The three apps (three GitHub repos, each deploys to Vercel from `main`)
| App | Repo | Live site | Size |
|---|---|---|---|
| Student | SiddheshNagawade/student-HM | student-hm.vercel.app | phone, 390 x 844 |
| Technician (Hindi first, English small) | SiddheshNagawade/technician-HM | technician-hm.vercel.app | phone, 390 x 844 |
| Supervisor desk | SiddheshNagawade/Supervisor-HM | supervisor-hm.vercel.app | desktop, 1440 x 900 |

Clone all three side by side in one folder. Push to `main` when he asks (he usually wants every round pushed).
Commit message footer: `Co-Authored-By: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>` (no model names in commits).

## Figma (source of truth)
File key `vl2TtBS0hNrZqJHNGiQIs2`, page "v3" (node 217:32). Student, Technician and Supervisor sections.
Rules he gave:
- Copy the Figma elements and drawings exactly. Do not invent new UI elements or restyle with your own colours.
- Animate HIS illustrations, once (never looping), in a way that matches the drawing (plane flies its dotted trail, notes slap on, stamps come down, beaver settles, fan spins down).
- No text animations. Graphics only.
- Titles and buttons must not be changed. Helper sentences that repeat what the screen shows were removed on purpose; keep it breathable.

## How the code works (same in all three repos)
Vite + React + TypeScript + Tailwind + framer-motion.
- `src/<app>/fig.json`: the Figma screens as data (every layer: position, size, fill, stroke, font, text). Edited copies of Figma text live here (for example times changed to daytime).
- `public/fig/<node-id>.svg`: every Figma drawing exported as SVG (node id with ":" replaced by "-").
- `src/fig/Fig.tsx`: draws a Figma screen 1:1. Screens attach behaviour by Figma node id through "binds" (`text`, `hide`, `onClick`, `render`, `wrap`, `art`, `style`, `input`, `dy`).
- `src/fig/anim.tsx`: one-time animations (PlaneFlight, Slap, StampDown, PlaceDown, PopIn, RiseIn, Settle, Hop, WalkIn, Reveal, SpinDown...).
- `src/fig/mascot.tsx`: the beaver as a guide. `peek({ say, sub, mood })` makes his big head rise from the bottom edge with a speech bubble; `<Hanging>` = upside down with a sign (error pages); `<OfflineBuddy>` = drops in when the internet goes, then only his upside-down head stays at the top.
- `src/ds/*`: stage (phone frame on laptop, full screen on phone), nav (screen stack + transitions), fx (sounds), ui.
- `src/data/iitr.ts`: `createStore` (localStorage store) and IIT Roorkee mock data.
- Student: `src/student/{screens.tsx, store.ts, App.tsx, wheel.tsx}`. `wheel.tsx` = the visit-time wheel on the dotted circle (drag / scroll / arrows).
- Technician: `src/tech/{screens.tsx, store.ts, App.tsx, voice.ts}`; voice clips in `public/voice/{hi,en}/*.mp3` made by `scripts/make_voices.py` (Piper TTS).
- Supervisor: `src/supervisor/{screens.tsx, store.ts, App.tsx}`. The navy rail is drawn once in App (never moves); dialogs (merge, escalate, reassign) are rendered above everything from the Figma dialog frames.
- Any screen can be opened directly with `?s=<screen-id>` (ids are in each App.tsx).

## Shared code
`src/ds`, `src/fig`, `src/data`, `src/index.css`, `tailwind.config.js` are the same in all three repos.
The master copy is in `student-hm/tools/shared/` with `tools/sync-shared.sh`. Change the shared code once, then copy it into all three repos (the script expects a folder layout of `shared/` next to the three repos; adjust paths or copy by hand).

## Figma export tools
`student-hm/tools/figma/`: `dumper.js` / `dumper_sup.js` (scripts for the Figma plugin API through the Figma MCP `use_figma` tool, read-only), `extract.py`, `sections.json` (where each frame sits in its section), `screens.json` (all 83 frames as data), `kit.json`.

## Product rules already decided
- Institute email format: `name@design.iitr.ac.in` (any `...iitr.ac.in` accepted).
- Technicians work 10 AM to 6 PM. All visit times, slots, shifts and timelines are inside that.
- Student free-hours grid columns are 10–12, 12–2, 2–4, 4–6.
- Tappable parts of drawings show a soft yellow glow (hint once on first view); no "+" icons on top of drawings.
- Responsive: phone apps scale to fit without stretching; the supervisor desk keeps a readable minimum size and scrolls sideways on small screens.

## Mascot (done)
The beaver now uses seven hand-drawn poses made in his ChatGPT chat, traced to flat SVG with exactly four colours (`public/fig/mascot-*.svg`):
- `mascot-peek-1..3`: neutral, wave, wink (head and paws over the bottom edge). `mascot-cheer-1..2`: big-head shout, big-head thumbs up. `mascot-hang-1..2`: hanging with a blank sign, still and leaning.
- `src/fig/mascot.tsx` plays them as one-time frame sequences: `peek()` (wave = neutral/wave/neutral/wave, point = neutral then wink, cheer, thumbs, think = tilt), `<Hanging>` (drops in, leans left, right, settles; the sign text leans with the sign) and `<OfflineBuddy>` (then only his head stays at the top).
- Sources and the pipeline: `tools/mascot-refs/poses/*.png` (raw images, kept locally and not committed), `tools/mascot-refs/make-vectors.cjs` (needs `npm i sharp @neplex/vectorizer`; the result is in `tools/mascot-refs/vectors/`). In dev, `window.__peek({ mood, say })` shows him for testing.
- `PeekHost` no longer takes `arts`; `Hanging` and `OfflineBuddy` no longer take `art` or `sign`.

## Extra life (done): `src/fig/extras.tsx`
Shared file (master in `student-hm/tools/shared/src/fig/`), plays once, never animates text:
- `ScoreDial`: half-circle of dots plus a needle that swings and settles (supervisor desk "open now" dial; student tracker step dial in the header of `detail`).
- `InkStamp`: brick stamp mark that falls, squashes and sends out one ink ring (supervisor closure review, on the "after" photo, then the next closure shows).
- `StepHop`: a token that hops from one step marker to the next (student `detail` when the job moved since the student last looked, tech `done`).
- `EdgePeeker`: soft blob peeking over a screen edge, blinks once, eyes follow the pointer, tap = it ducks and comes back (student welcome and profile; supervisor fixtures, blocked, disputes, team).
- The student time wheel's `Sun` is a clock: hour and minute hands turn to the chosen slot.
- The forecast's two over-the-line dots now hop over to Monday. Do not use framer-motion keyframe arrays together with `initial` or `delay` for new motion: they jumped straight to the end here; drive such motion by hand (see `StepHop`, `InkStamp`).
- Removed on purpose (they only repeated the screen): desk subtitle sentence, "closure 1 of 6", dispute sub-line, supervisor tech "their phone shows Hindi...", student slot range text, "Optional", what's-wrong helper line, tech job counters (jobs list and done screen).

## Hand-drawn repair icons and the builder (done)
- `public/fig/fix-<item>-hero.svg` and `fix-<item>-1..3.svg`: big picture plus one small picture per problem for light, switch, window, door, bed, table, lamp, washroom, stairs. They are used on the student "What is it doing / What is wrong?" screen (`FIX` map in `src/student/screens.tsx`); Corridor and Common room reuse them and the Figma fan drawing.
- `public/fig/build-1..3.svg` (wind-up, hit, cheer) and `build-log.svg`: `BuilderLoader` / `BuildOverlay` in `src/fig/extras.tsx`. One hammer hit per log, a 3-2-1 pile, then a cheer, played once. Used when the student sends a report and when the technician enters the right closing code.
- New page transition `board` in `src/ds/nav.tsx`: a board rises with the beaver holding its edge (student sim moves, technician job close).
- Pipeline: `tools/mascot-refs/make-icons.cjs` (sheets in, SVGs out, 5 app colours: navy, cream, yellow, tan, light blue). The sheets are made in his ChatGPT chat, one item per image: a big picture on top and a row of 3 small ones below.
- Style rule from him: big illustrations are rough pen sketches (wobbly navy line, loose marker colour, paper showing); small icons may stay clean. The 9 student hero pictures (ix-<item>-hero.svg) are sketches. Icons: supervisor sidebar ico-rail-*.svg, technician bag ico-bag-*.svg and job steps ico-step-*.svg (made by make-icons.cjs ... sets; sketches by ... sketches).
- Supervisor page: fills any window (rail pinned left, desk centred in the room left over); the logo turns into a sidebar toggle on hover and the rail opens with labels (state kept in localStorage lign.sup.rail, shortcut Shift+Ctrl/Cmd+S).
- Tool loaders (ToolLoader / ToolOverlay in src/fig/extras.tsx, parts 	ool-*.svg, pen sketches): rocket screwdriver = supervisor confirms (Accept and assign, Merge, Escalate, Reassign, Save rules, via usy() in the supervisor Ctx); wrench and bolt = student sends to supervisor, books a new slot, joins a report; bulb = student code check and technician PIN. Timing is by hand in rAF (clamp the clock to >= 0: the first frame can be before t0).

## Loading and fitting (done)
- A screen never shows half drawn: `Fig` waits for the fonts and all its drawings (`src/fig/preload.ts`), shows a quiet row of dots only if that takes more than a moment, then mounts. Art drawn later by a bind is passed in `need`.
- One request per screen: `scripts/make-bundles.cjs` (npm `prebuild`) packs drawings into `public/fig/_b/<frame>.json` (git-ignored); other screens are fetched in idle time. `vercel.json` sets cache headers.
- Fitting: `src/ds/viewport.ts` + `PhoneBox` in `src/ds/stage.tsx` (rotation, keyboard, resize). Shared code master: `student-hm/tools/shared`.

## Checking work
Build: `npx vite build`; preview: `npx vite preview --port 4301`. Use Playwright (390x844 for phone apps, 1440x900 for the desk) to screenshot every screen and catch console errors before pushing. Compare against Figma screenshots when layout changes.

## Round notes: sound, language, camera, navbar, photos, one loader
- Sound: `src/ds/fx.ts` unlocks audio on the first touch (also a silent blip for iOS); technician voice clips are fetched ahead (`src/tech/voice.ts`, `preloadVoice`) and the speaker shows `loading` (turning ring) then `playing` (yellow, waves pulse) via `SpeakerFx` in `src/tech/screens.tsx`.
- Language: `LangCtx` in `src/fig/Fig.tsx`. In English every Hindi / English pair on a screen swaps places (big line stays big, font shrinks to fit); lone Hindi lines go through `src/tech/english.ts`. The top toggle is a two-half "हिं | EN" switch (`LangToggle`), the language screen is never swapped.
- Camera: `src/ds/camera.tsx` (`takePhoto` opens the camera on a phone, the file chooser on a laptop, shrinks to 800 px JPEG; `Shot` draws a photo in the app's frame). Used in student doing / what's wrong / review, technician working polaroids and close-with-photo.
- Technician bottom bar: `src/tech/dock.tsx` (Jobs, Bag, History, Profile) on jobs, last, bag, history, profile; those screens move their big button up (negative `dy`).
- Supervisor: round back button (`BackBtn`) on review, closure, blockedOne, disputeOne, fixtureOne, tech, rules; designer notes and arrows removed (same fixture note, same angle note, "Tuesday is the squeeze" and its arrow, the dotted arrow on the desk).
- Photos: real hostel photographs in `public/photos/*.jpg` (Wikimedia Commons, credits in `public/photos/CREDITS.txt`); supervisor review / closure / disputes / blocked, technician job details ("Photo from the student", or "No photo given"), working polaroids.
- One loader everywhere: the beaver hammering a pile together (`BuilderLoader` / `BuildOverlay`; `ToolOverlay` now just shows it) and a small hammering beaver while a screen's pictures load. The old rocket / spanner / bulb scenes are retired.
- One beaver per frame: `src/fig/mascotState.ts`; while the guide beaver peeks, hangs or the offline buddy is up, layers named "Beaver / ..." turn invisible.
- No sideways scrolling anywhere (`overflow-x: hidden`, `touch-action: pan-y`, supervisor always fits the whole width); vertical pull to refresh is left to the browser.
- Student report flow: several problems can be tapped on one item, extra problems can be typed (chips) and a description box sits under the tiles (`draft.issues`, `draft.others`, `draft.note`). Several visit times can be added, on one day or several (`draft.times`); there is no "let them in" option any more. Who comes is decided by WHAT is wrong (`tradeOfIssue` in `src/student/screens.tsx`), not by where it is: a dead light on the stairs goes to the electrician.
- Places: only a student's own room is "Room"; corridor, washroom, common room, stairs and the pump room are shared places. Supervisor data carries `place` (`whereOf` in `src/supervisor/store.ts`). Technician jobs carry their own steps, photo caption and part (`steps3`, `photoHi/photoEn`, `part`), so a tube-light job never talks about a fan.
- Technician bar uses the supervisor sidebar's pictures (`ico-rail-*.svg`); supervisor section screens (check, forecast, blocked, disputes, fixtures, team) have a back button to the desk.
- Technician bar is on every screen after signing in. `BottomPadCtx` (Fig.tsx) keeps its height free: the bottom group of a screen (everything below the last empty gap) is lifted together, never further than the gap above it.
- Inputs must be 16 px or larger and the viewport has `maximum-scale=1`; smaller inputs made iPhones zoom the page and every later screen sat off to one side.
- Supervisor: after the first sign-in a "Bhawan details" screen asks for the Bhawan (list from `src/ds/bhawans.ts`, written from memory, check against the institute list) and the number of blocks. Every review report shows a similar older report (`sim` in `store.ts`), so all review pages have the same parts. The desk has the open-now dial above "Needs you" and no Bhawan chooser.
- Student: the Bhawan is chosen from the list, rooms can have three digits.
- Bottom bar (technician): `PhoneStage` takes `bar`; it is drawn across the whole window, stuck to the bottom edge, and the screen sits on it (spare room goes above, in the screen's own colour). Text pairs in the language swap need a real English line (3+ letters), and a text can opt out with `keep: true`.
- Technician job screen: the blue top is 130 px shorter than the Figma (`230-692.svg` cropped, layers below moved up in `fig.json`), with the student's message and photo card in the freed space. Student places all use the same selected state (yellow card, same hard shadow). Student request detail has "Go to home".
